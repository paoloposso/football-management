# Run tests
Run `npm install` on the root folder.
Run `npm test`.
I'm using Jest to execute the tests.
The js files inside /test folder contain the tests that call the Business modules.

# Data / Schemas
The /data folder contains the json with the data used in the tests.
the file schema.json contains the main data and the file schema-additional.json contains the redundancy data for optimizing queries and filters.
